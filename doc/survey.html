		<h3>Initial Research</h3>
		<section class="column">
			<p>The first step was to research the current state of the mobile landscape.</p>
			
			<h5>Windows</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Flat aesthetic</li>
				<li>Strong underlying grid structure</li>
				<li>Hierarchy is established through typography, repetition and contrast</li>
				<li>Hue range is small, or all colors are the same tone</li>
				<li>Elements are opaque</li>
				<li>UI is consistent across platforms, and the Windows website also displays patterns found in the UI</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The new look of Windows shifts away from desktop computing towards mobile, touch-friendly experiences, which can be personalized by applying different color schemes. Typography, a strong grid, and use of color play key roles in establishing hierarchy. They're also thinking about scale: "Semantic Zoom" is a feature that customizes items depending on the zoom level you are viewing them at, rather than just making them bigger or smaller as you zoom in and out.</p>

			<h5>Android/Google Apps</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Flat aesthetic with very few embellishments</li>
				<li>Hierarchy is established through color and scale</li>
				<li>Color use and palette are minimal</li>
				<li>Gradients, shadows and shine are understated when used</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Google tends towards a simpler, cleaner look, and over the past few years has been evolving their designs, primarily through additional whitespace, the removal/simplification of existing elements and a drive towards flat design. UI and color choices for iOS and Android aren't entirely consistent–iOS apps are aligned more stylistically with the rest of Google's web presence.</p>

			<h5>iOS/OS X</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Skeuomorphic aesthetic</li>
				<li>Underlying grid</li>
				<li>Hierarchy is achieved through proximity and contrast</li>
				<li>Elements look touchable, rounded, reflective and shiny</li>
				<li>Elements and backgrounds are often textured</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Apple has always been a trendsetter, and their UI elements are often copied by others. They still rely on skeuomorphism for many of the elements in their desktop and mobile platforms, which are becoming more consistent in terms of UI design. Both platforms make little use of whitespace, especially when compared to Apple's online/advertising presence.</p>

			<h5>Adobe</h5>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Moving towards a semi-flat aesthetic</li>
				<li>Hierarchy is established through positioning and scale</li>
				<li>Shift towards simpler elements</li>
				<li>Moving from a lighter color palette towards are darker one, especially for menu/toolbar areas</li>
				<li>Topcoat and product UIs are similar</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Adobe positions itself as a conservative and pro-oriented company, and their brand  is established through color, which is also often used in small amounts to establish hierarchy in its UIs. Even though they are originally a digital type company, it doesn't play a role in their current UI design, or in the Topcoat documents; however, several of their online services and websites (Edge and Typekit) place a large emphasis on type.</p>
